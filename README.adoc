= Straight Reward

Based on the link:https://github.com/luminousspice/anki-addons/tree/master/Straight_Reward[add-on of the same name] by link:https://github.com/luminousspice[luminousspice].

This addon increases the ease of Anki cards for which you consecutively have answered "Good", or "Easy".
Such an answer is considered a "success".
If you have successes often enough to apply for an ease increase, it is considered "straight success".

==== Setting the Options

After installing the addon you will another option tab under the deck options called "Straight Rewards":

* "Begin at straight of length": Length of what is considered a straight success. At this length, ease rewards will be applied. The value is the same as deactivating Straight Rewards. (default: 0)
* "Base ease reward": One of the two values for calculating the ease reward. (default: 15)
* "Step ease reward": One of the two values for calculating the ease reward. (default: 5)
* "Start at ease": Only cards with an ease factor between (inclusive) "Start Ease" and "Stop Ease" are considered for ease rewards. (default: 130)
* "Stop at ease": Only cards with an ease factor between (inclusive) "Start Ease" and "Stop Ease" are considered for ease rewards. (default: 130)

==== Calculating Ease Rewards

.Formula for calculating the Ease Reward
----
base_reward + step_reward * (strait_length - required_straight_length)
----

An Example:
. You rated a card "Good" for the sixth time in a row.
. The card currently has an ease factor of 250%.
. You have a straigth length of 4
. You have a base reward of 15%
. You have a step reward of 5%
. You have a start ease of 130%
. You have a stop ease of 270%

So in this case we have a straight success (6 ≥ 4).
The formula yields: "15% + 5% ⋅ (6 - 4) = 15% + 10% = 25%"
So the answer is final ease is "250% + 25% = 275%". But Wait!
275% is more than the stop ease of 270%: So the ease will be set to the maximum ease of 270%.

== Deteching Straight Successes

The addon knows two mechanisms to detect cards which apply for an ease reward:
. the review hook
. the sync hook

==== The Review Hook

The review hook increases the ease of cards during the review.
You will get a notification whenever a success straight is detected.
The Review hook respects the "Undo" feature.

==== The Sync Hook

The sync hook increases the ease of cards during syncing.
Applies when you do reviews on another platform (e.g. AnkiMobile or AnkiDroid) and sync those to Desktop Anki.
Anki which 

There are some limits to this approach:
Every card is only considered once for an ease reward.
Two example scenarioes:

If you're on a mobile platform, and:
. you rate a card "Good", and then a few days later...
. you sync it "Hard", and then another few days later...
. you sync to Anki Desktop, _no ease reward_ can be applied for the first "Good" rating.

If you're on a mobile platform, and:
. you rate a card "Good", and then a few days later...
. you sync it "Good", and then another few days later...
. you sync to Anki Desktop, _only one ease reward_ might be applied for the second "Good" rating, the first one will be ignored.

Both of these problems can be avoided, if you just sync often enough.
I think once a week would already enough to encounter neither of these issues.
